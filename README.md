# Hybrid ACO for a Permutation Flow-shop Problem
This repository contains the implementation of a Hybrid Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm designed to solve the Permutation Flow Shop Problem (PFSP). The PFSP is a classic optimization problem in operations research where the goal is to determine the optimal sequence of jobs to minimize the makespan on a series of machines.

Key features of this implementation include:

* Ant Colony Optimization (ACO): Utilizes ACO principles to explore and exploit potential solutions.
* Hybrid Approach: Combines ACO with local search techniques to enhance solution quality and convergence speed.
